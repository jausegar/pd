#X text 238 340 The number can also output continuous values via blue
outlet that can be used in manipulating sound.;
#X text 238 373 IMPORTANT! Like any other control data \, the number
data is sent only in that moment when the number is entered and the
user has pressed enter and not continuously \, like audio signal does.
This means if you change a value inside a number and connect that number
to an object afterwards \, the receiving object will have never received
entered value unless you re-enter such value and send it through the
newly formed connection.;
#X text 239 195 The Math Number object simply displays the current
value of the numbers passing through it. You can set the value of the
number by clicking the number and dragging the mouse up or down. The
outlet outputs the same number that is connected to the inlet \, unless
you change it by clicking on the number box and dragging to a different
number. In that case \, the output will be whatever you set the number
to.;
#X text 238 295 You can use its right inlet to output the stored value
when the input equals the ID number. You can set the ID number to a
value equal or greater than zero.;
