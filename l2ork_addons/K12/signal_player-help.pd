#X text 227 423 To Open a File: click on the yellow open button.;
#X text 227 335 To Playback: Send into left inlet the number of the
desired pitch. A pitch of 60 plays the original sound as it was recorded.
The Player will only playback the range you specify with the start
and end sliders with the leftmost side being the beginning of the sound
and the rightmost its end. Use the first preset to play the sound at
pitch 60;
#X text 227 508 Looping sound: As shown in this example \, we can loop
the sound by using the second outlet. Every time the sound stops \,
the second outlet will output a 1 If we use this to push the value
stored in the right number above the player \, as long as there is
a 1 inside it the sound will continue to loop. Once you change the
right number's value to 0 the Player will stop looping. Recall the
second preset to preview the loop mode.;
#X text 227 162 The Player object allows you to play soundfiles at
different speeds and in different directions. The left inlet sets the
playback pitch (default 60). 60 plays the original sound without any
chance. Less than 60 lowers the pitch and increases duration \, while
numbers higher than 60 result in higher pitch and shorter duration.
The right inlet allows you to play the same sound with same settings
again by sending it a 1 or stop the playing sound by sending it a 0
You can pick at what point the sound starts and ends with the sliders.
If you put the start slider past the end slider \, then the sample
will play backwards. The left outlet outputs the sound \, while the
right one outputs 1 when the sound playback is over. You can use the
output from the right outlet to loop the sound (see below).;
#X text 226 453 To preview the sound \, click on the green play button.
It will play the sound using the last requested pitch and specified
starting and ending points.;
